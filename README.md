# ColorSnapGame

The ColorSnap Game is a decentralized, on-chain game built on ETh, where players match colored bottles to a target configuration to earn points. Players connect their EVM compatible wallet, set a display name, start a game, swap bottles off-chain to match the target, and submit their solution to compete on a global leaderboard. The game uses a Solidity smart contract for game logic and a Next.js frontend with TypeScript and Thirdweb for a seamless user experience.
